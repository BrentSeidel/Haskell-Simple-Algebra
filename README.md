# Haskell-Simple-Algebra
I heard that Haskell had a "literate programming" form that integrated with LaTeX and
decided to try it.  The result is a simple computer algebra program.  The .tex files
can be run through LaTeX to generate the documentation.  The .lhs files are simply
soft-links to the .tex files.  They can be fed into the Haskell interpreter of your
choice and are the source code for the program.

It's been a few years since I tinkered with this, but I hope that someone finds it
interesting and/or useful.  It's a bit more than a few short examples and a bit less
than some monstrous application.  If you look closely, you can even tell where I
stopped.
